I am a PhD Scholar of artificial intelligence at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Italy. I have experience of various NLP, computational linguistics and machine/deep learning projects, and interested to solve complex nature problems of the society specifically in AI.

*Recent works*:
- Working on a research project in the area of explainable artificial intelligence. This work is supposed to be submitted in ACL'21.
- Working on a neural network based character level transliteration of punjabi language specifically on its two main scripts.
- Recently published a work on similarities of hindustani languages, mainly Urdu and Hindi.
